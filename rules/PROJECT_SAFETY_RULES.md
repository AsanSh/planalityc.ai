# 🛡️ PROJECT SAFETY RULES — MUST FOLLOW ALWAYS

## DATABASE & USER DATA
- NEVER drop, truncate, or delete tables that contain user data
- NEVER run destructive migrations without explicit confirmation
- NEVER seed/reset database in production environment
- NEVER delete existing users, sessions, or auth records
- When modifying schema — use ALTER TABLE, not DROP + CREATE
- Always create a backup strategy before any migration
- If migration could lose data — STOP and ask user first

## CODE CHANGES
- NEVER delete existing API endpoints — only add new ones or deprecate
- NEVER change authentication logic without explicit request
- NEVER remove environment variables — only add new ones
- When refactoring — keep old function signatures until new ones are tested
- Do NOT remove error handling code even if it "looks messy"

## FILE OPERATIONS
- NEVER delete config files (.env, .env.example, docker-compose.yml, etc.)
- NEVER overwrite migration files that have already been run
- When replacing a file — show diff first and ask for approval
- NEVER delete seed files or fixture data

## BEFORE MAKING CHANGES
1. State exactly what you are going to change
2. State what could break as a result
3. If the change touches DB or auth — ask for explicit confirmation
4. Prefer small incremental changes over large rewrites

## MIGRATIONS SPECIFICALLY
- Generate migration files, do NOT run them automatically
- Name migrations descriptively: `add_column_users_stripe_id` not `update1`
- Always include a rollback/down migration
- Test migration on dev DB first — never run directly on prod data

## WHEN IN DOUBT
- Ask before deleting anything
- Ask before changing database schema
- Ask before modifying auth/session logic
- Default answer to "should I remove this?" is NO
